              consists of providing a platform to help you prepare, submit, and
              track your loan application, which is then forwarded to our
              third-party lending partners for their evaluation and approval.

            <p>
              Submitting an application through our platform does not guarantee
              loan approval. The final decision to approve or reject an
              application, as well as the loan terms (amount, interest rate,
              tenure), rests solely with our lending partners.
